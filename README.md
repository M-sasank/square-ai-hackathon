## 2)Accessibility Features:
* ## our application also enhances Square's accessibility by incorporating AI-driven features such as voice-guided navigation, for example: Customer gives his current location in voice as input and we'll show the shortest possible path for the customer to reach his desired product destination.

* ## the second idea gives benefit for the customer to navigte faster for his desired product.
* ## Based on the current data present it gives special benifits/gift cards for the customers to gain attraction.
